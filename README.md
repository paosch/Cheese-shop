# Ned Ned's Cheese Emporium

This is a program for an online artisan cheese shop called Ned Ned's Cheese Emporium. The customers are UK-based and pay £19.99 per order.

The business buys cheese from France in euros, and in order to make a profit it must charge at least €3.24 per block of cheese sold.

The program makes a call to an external API to get the GBP/EUR exchange rate in real time, and Ned Ned's Cheese Emporium's website shows a message telling the customer how many blocks of cheese they can get for their £19.99.
